# Bio 1XX CSMC 110: Biology Through Computing
### Spring 2015

### Instructors:
Joshua Shapiro & Douglas Blank

## Course Description

This course is an introduction to biology through computer science, or an introduction to computer science through biology. The course will examine biological systems through the application of computer science, exploring concepts from bioinformatics, evolution, ecology, and molecular biology through the practice of writing and modifying code in the Python programming language. The course will introduce students to the subject matter and branches of computer science as an academic discipline, and the nature, development, coding, testing, documenting and analysis of the efficiency and limitations of algorithms.

## Textbook and Readings

For the computer science topics of the course, we will be using *Python Programming, Second Edition* by John Zelle. (or another textbook TBA). Be sure to get the second edition, as 

Readings on biological topics will be taken from a variety of sources, with all readings posted on the course website.
