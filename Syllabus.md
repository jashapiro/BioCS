# Bio 1XX C: Biology Through Computing
### Spring 2015

### Instructors:
Joshua Shapiro & Douglas Blank

## Course Description

This course is an introduction to biology through computer science, or and introduction to computer science through biology. The course will examine biological systems through the application of computer science, exploring concepts from bioinformatics, evolution, ecology, and molecular biology through the practice of writing and modifying code in the Python programming language. The course will introduce students to the subject matter and branches of computer science as an academic discipline, and the nature, development, coding, testing, documenting and analysis of the efficiency and limitations of algorithms.

## Texbook and Readings

For the computer science topics of the course, we will be using *Python Programming, Second Edition* by John Zelle. (or another textbook TBA). Be sure to get the second edition, as 

Readings on biological topics will be taken from a variety of sources, with all readings posted on the course website.

## Support Services and Accommodations

Bryn Mawr offers a variety of resources to help students thrive in their academic endeavors while managing stress and maintaining mental health. For further information on those services, consult the [Support Services website](http://www.brynmawr.edu/academicsupport/StudentSupportServices.html) or contact Rachel Heiser, Academic Support and Learning Resources Specialist in the Dean’s Office, with questions: ([rheiser@brynmawr.edu](mailto:rheiser@brynmawr.edu), 610-526-5275) 

Students who think they may need accommodations in this course due to the impact of a learning, physical, or psychological disability are encouraged to meet with me privately early in the semester to discuss their concerns.  Students should also contact Deb Alder, Student Access Coordinator ([dalder@brynmawr.edu](mailto:rdalder@brynmawr.edu), 610–526–7351), as soon as possible, to verify their eligibility for reasonable academic accommodations.  Early contact will help to avoid unnecessary inconvenience and delays.
