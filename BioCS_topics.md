## Biological problems for computing

* GC content of a sequence/set of sequences
  * Download DNA sequences for a set of species and compare
  * Genes and non-genes
  * content along chromosome

* Random genetic drift & selection in a population
  * Effects of population size
  * Haploid vs. diploid / additive vs. dominance
  * Migration 
  
* Dynamic models -- stochastic models:
  * Lac operon dynamics
  * Predator prey systems: Lotka-Volterra
  * SIR(S) model of Epidemics (add birth/death & evolution?)

* Sequence alignment
  * Global vs. local
  * Multiple alignment  

* Mating/recombination/mapping
  * relatedness of relatives
  * comparison of mating schemes

* Flocking / behavior
* Foraging
* Dispersal
