# Assignment Ideas

## Modeling Life:
* [Assignment 1](https://athena.brynmawr.edu/jupyter/hub/dblank/public//BioCS/notebooks/Lab01.ipynb): Move to find food 
  * picobot
  * rules to cover space
  * 
* [Assignment 2](https://athena.brynmawr.edu/jupyter/hub/dblank/public//BioCS/notebooks/Lab02.ipynb): Move randomly to find food. 
  * if() statements and loops
  * Optimal foraging theory: 
    * energy use
    * distributions of food

## DNA statistics:
* Assignment 3: GC counting
  * file access, variables, math & plotting (matplotlib)
  * variation among species
  * variation across a genome
  * coding vs. noncoding regions

* Assignment 4: Translation and identifying coding regions
  * arrays, dictionaries
  * DNA transcription and translation
  * Codon counting & position: integer division & modulus
  * Advanced: identify coding by presence of transcription start site


## Population genetics
* Assignment 5: Random genetic drift
  * 2 allele model: fixation depends on starting frequency
  * selecting randomly from an array: random numbers int vs float

* Assignment 6: Mutations
  * Randomly mutate a DNA sequence
  * Translate the new sequence
  * What proportion of mutations change the sequence? Does this depend on the sequence?

* Assignment 7: Mutations and drift
  * Combine mutations in DNA sequence with drift
  * Calculate allele frequencies in the population
  * Infinite sites vs. finite sites.
  * Neutral Allele frequency spectrum

* Assignment 8: Natural selection
  * How does fixation speed/probability depend on selection & population size?
  * Selection with mutation : calculate fitness as a function of match to protein sequence

* Assignment 9: Haploid & Diploid
  * Objects: Individuals with one or two DNA sequences
  * fitness of diploids: additive vs dominant/recessive
  * modify previous code to simulate individuals, rather than alleles
  * Diploids need to mate to reproduce: pick two parents per next generation individual

* Assignment 10: Recombination
  * Mating between diploid individuals
  * Recombination before mating
  * Effect of recombination on speed of adaptation/selection

## Sequence alignment
* Assignment: Calculate similarity score for an alignment
  * Affine vs fixed gap penalties
  * DNA vs protein

* Assignment: Global/or local alignment
  * Arrays & references

* Assignment: Local alignment
