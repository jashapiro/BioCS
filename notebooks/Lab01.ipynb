    "## Ladybug Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first simulation is a discrete simulation: the world is divided into discrete locations (called patches) and the world operates in discrete time steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Ladybug world looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/ladybug-simulation.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be writing a brain for the Ladybug, the black and red circle in the middle of the world. In the above image, ladybug is facing up. Ladybug can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* turn left or right, but only in a grid-like manner\n",
    "* go forward or backward specific distances\n",
    "* sense the world immediately in front of it, and in its peripheral view\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing a Brain\n",
    "\n",
    "Brains for the Ladybug Simulation are composed of a set of rules. You can have as many rules as you wish.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rules are composed of the following parts, separated by spaces:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "STATE    SENSE-PATTERN   ->    ACTION     NEXT-STATE\n",
    "```\n",
    "In your brain, you can also have comments (lines that start with a #) and blank lines. Here is a very simple brain:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is my first brain!\n",
    "\n",
    "0         *****          ->    forward(1)  0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's examine each part of a rule to find out what this does.\n",
    "\n",
    "### STATE and NEXT-STATE\n",
    "\n",
    "State is a name used as a simple memory for your ladybug. Ladybugs always start out in state \"0\". States can be any name with no spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SENSE-PATTERN\n",
    "\n",
    "Ladybugs can see in the 5 cells near the front of its head. In the following pictures, the ladybug can see the patches with a yellow circle in the, and cannot see the patches that are just green.\n",

    "Your agent has an energy level. It starts at 100, and decreases with the amount of energy it expends. If it gets down to zero, it dies."
